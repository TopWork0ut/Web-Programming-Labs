# Second Lab


### Description: 

-  Improve a landing page ( Lab 1 ) following the given design (same as previous) by adding full responsiveness and some animation.


### Conditions:

- The website should be partly responsive:
Required: for 320px (iPhone 5s)  2560px (4K screens).
Hint: for extra-large screen width, you can just fit website content inside a previously set container for the regular screen width and centre it horizontally.
  
- The header should collapse to a hamburger on small screens
  
- The website must contain animations (at least 3). Can be made in any possible way, preferably with css properties (animation/transition).

- Your project should be logically structured (all your CSS canâ€™t be in just one-two files)

- All of the previous work requirements must be kept.
  

### Resutls:

- 4K screen (3860 - 2160):
