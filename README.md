# The seventh Lab


### Description: 


-  Continue work on your React App by adding a page with Items list (see the link to wireframe of Catalog page above).



### Requirements:


- All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.


- Code style:
	Use array.map() method for rendering your items list
	
	Routing (switching between pages) should work now.
	
	Use react-router-dom library: https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start
	
	All UI elements (buttons / select) should have corresponding React components (PrimaryButton.jsx / Select.jsx  etc.)
	
	
- Functionality (filter / search / view more) is still not required (you have to complete it on next works)
