# The ninth Lab

### Description: 

-  Finally! Now, you are about to put a final touches on all pages you created - implement interaction with your REST API server.

### Requirements:

- Backend - just as discussed before, can be the one you used for your 3-5 work or a new one created from scratch. Tech stack - absolutely up to you.

- All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
Code style:
Your items should be stored inside the state or context (your choice) of your page

- For any http request - use axios library
https://github.com/axios/axios#installing
All your API functions should be separated into single file (or folder, if you want) - just like you saw in Live coding for 5 lab with fetch() function
	
	
- Functionality:
On Catalog Page - all items should now be fetched from your backend with GET method (using axios)
Search with filters - should also be implemented with GET request (search by text field can be left as it is)
Hint: pass filters as url parameter
Before response from your GET method is received you have to display a Spinner(Loader component) to the user.
