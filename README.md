# Third Lab


### Description: 

-  In this work, you have to make a simple presentation part of a website


### Conditions:

- For your blocks you must use data from your java/python project class.

- Then using JavaScript, you need to implement the following operations on your data (it is up to you to decide which field should be used for each of the operations):

Sort of your items option
Search option
Count total amount of some of the field
(e.g total price of all cars)

### Requirements:

Responsiveness absolutely not required.
Styling is not important at all. Is up to you.

### Recommendations and tips:

Use JS Array methods: map(), sort(), filter(), reduce().
Use native JS for any DOM operations (querySelector | findById | insertAdjacentHTML | etc)
